    # try some SCI Command Examples

    # The SCI commands in the velox module have docstrings to describe 
    # their function, inputs, and outputs. 
    # You can print them from a Python command to see what the function does. 

    # print the docstring for the ReportKernelVersion command
    # ReportKernelVersion returns 2 values. 
    # here is the description of the command

    # ReportKernelVersion returns a version number and a description. 
    # You can acess the return values by name or by indexing the tuple.

    # as part of the function call.
    # here we get variables named ver and desc and use them directly
    ver, desc = velox.ReportKernelVersion()
    print('Got ', ver, 'and', desc)

    # The Echo Data command just returns its own first input.  
    # Echo data only returns the first string in the parameter list.
    # To get a string with spaces to display, we need to add double quotes.
    # Try it both ways to see the difference. The first one below does 
    # what we expect. The second only prints the first word. 
    # The third assigns a return value to a variable
